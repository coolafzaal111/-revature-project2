# project-2-repo
### **Idea about the project --**
##### Whenever we move goods or other items from one location to another, we require manpower. Many times, there isn't a single person available to buy goods for the house.
Then one can simply register and login to our Helper App platform and ask for assistance from other people who are available and willing to assist you in your immediate vicinity.
We simply need to do the following: 
* We require a platform for recruiting employees.
* Fill out the Location form.
* Look for someone who is available at that time.
* Contact him and Inquire about the charge and pay him as they see fit (By cash or online)

**User Stories--**
* As a customer, one can login and Register.
* As a customer, one can view the services provided by the website and can apply for a Helper(services).
* A customer can provide feedback for the services they use.
* As a Customer, one can also apply for providing the services as per the skills of oneself.

**Employee diary--**
* As an employee, I can approve or reject an account.
* As an employee, I can view a customer's accounts.
* Some functionality, such as a chat bot, is still in the works.
